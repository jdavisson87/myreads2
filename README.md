# My Reads 2.0

Welcome to the My Reads 2.0 app. This is a project that I had completed in my
Front End Web Development Nanodegree program, and I decided to implement everything
I've learned from that program to create a new, updated My Reads App.

In this application, there are 2 main pages. The first page is your personal bookshelf page,
that shows your 3 bookshelves. These shelves are:

Currently Reading
Wanting to Read
Finished Reading

The second page is the search page. When you are on the bookshelf page, if you click the
magnifying glass in the top left corner, it will send you to the search page. Here, you can
input your search criteria, and the application will call a book api and retrieve a list of
books that fit your search. As this is a small database, you can look in the
SEARCH_TERMS.md document to see what terms you can search and receive a book list. After you
type in your search criteria, the application will wait one second after you are done typing
before it starts the search, and then will populate the page with the books you have searched for.
If you find a book that you want to put on a shelf, click the selector icon that is on the bottom
left of the book image, and select which shelf you would like to place the book. Once you place
the book, when you go back to the bookshelf page by clicking the home icon in the top left, you
see the book placed on the shelf you have selected. If you wish to change shelves on the
bookshelf page, click the selector and select which shelf you would like to move that book to.
