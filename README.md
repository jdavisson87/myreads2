My Reads 2.0

Welcome to the My Reads 2.0 app.  This is a project that I had completed in my
Front End Web Development Nanodegree program, and I decided to implement everything
I've learned from that program to create a new, updated My Reads App.

## Getting Started

To get started, please be sure to clone or download all of the files for this app.
You can find these files at https://github.com/jdavisson87/myreads2

Once you have downloaded or cloned the files, go into your terminal and be sure
to download all of the node packages by running:

  npm install

After you run the install, run:

  npm run

and the application should pull up in your web browser.
